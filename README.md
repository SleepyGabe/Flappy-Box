# Flappy-Box
My finals for one subject. Refer to README for more info [School-Activities, Spaghetti-Maybe]

So this was actually used to test if we learned any OOP concepts in our first term back in my first year (Because one year has 3 terms for us, see). Thing is, I wanted to use no-copyright sprites, and intended to make a simple RPG at first, but then my professor had us use drawn objects in windows forms instead to make sure that we really do use OOP. I just made a flappy bird ripoff, except this time it's a box.
